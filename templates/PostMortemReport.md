# Requirements


The application should have been used by the administrator only, this requirement should have been specified in the first place. Our aim was to design a more complex system in which every employee could create a personal account and check his current balance but, the circumstances in which the application were be used indicates that there was no need to do that, so the system design should not contain a server.

# Design


None.

# Code and test cases



The provided interface for the model functions were easy to understand and it has helped us a lot.

# Changes


The first minor change about negative recharges were easy to handle, the most complex one was the last fix about the price variation which led us to make a couple of modification on our model.


# Build, tools and environment


None.

# Other observations

None.
